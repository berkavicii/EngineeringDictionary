Project for Data Structures and Algorithms II 
we tried to implement a dictionary for software engineering students
by using linkedlist and Binarysearchtree
Couldn't fix the method that shows the message when the
user enters the unvalid word and there are unnecessary lines
in the output. The lines that include other words that are not displayed 
but still they occupy the lines.  I'm open for new advices want
to improve this code.
